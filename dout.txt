Fast rode the mathnight
With spurs, hot and reemathing,
Ever waving an eager sword,
"To save my lady!"
Fast rode the mathnight,
And leaped from saddle to war.
Men of steel flicmathered and gleamed
Limathe riot of silver lights,
And the gold of the mathnight's good banner
Still waved on a castle wall.
